A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling |  A numeric feature with no missing values. Good idea to apply scaling, as the range of values (17 to 90) is quite different compared to other numeric features.|\n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | We use imputation because there are some missing values but most are non-null so we can fill in the missing values without skewing the results. One-hot encoding is used for categorical features. It helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. |\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | It's a feature that represents the weight of each data row (number of people each row represents). For our prediction, repeated data does not matter |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | Education is a categorical feature with a known relationship/order between each category (ie. Doctorate is a higher education level than Masters, so Doctorate has a higher ordinal encoding). We use ordinal encoding to preserve the order. |\n",
    "| education.num | drop | The education level is already represented in the \"education\" column, so \"education.num\" is unnecessary because the two are very similar. Number of year of education also represents academic background a bit worse, because people can take longer/shorter to finish the same level of education |\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | We use one-hot encoding because marital.status is a categorical feature. It helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | We use imputation because there are some missing values but most are non-null so we can fill in the missing values without skewing the results. We use one-hot encoding because occupation is a categorical feature. It helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. |\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | We use one-hot encoding because relationship is a categorical feature. One-hot encoding helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. |\n",
    "| race | drop  | Some categories seem to have significantly less data, which could cause underfitting of the model. I think it's better to keep this feature and use one-hot encoding because it's a categorical feature that can contribute to the prediction |\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | We use one-hot encoding because sex is a categorical feature. One-hot encoding helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. We use binary because there are only 2 possible categories, so only one column is necessary to represent the feature. |\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling | It's a numeric feature with no missing values and has a large range (0 to 99999). Scaling features with a smaller scale have more weight on the prediction and helps fit models more accurately | \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling | It's a numeric feature with no missing values and has a large range (0 to 4356). Scaling makes features with a smaller scale have more weight on the prediction and helps fit models more accurately  |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling | It's a numeric feature with no missing values. Good idea to apply scaling, as the range of values (1 to 99) is different compared to other numeric features. This ensures features contribute equally to the prediction |\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding | We use imputation because there are some missing values but most are non-null so we can fill in the missing values without skewing the results. We use one-hot encoding because native.country is a categorical feature. It helps ML algorithm make use of categories in prediction without placing more weight on one category over the other. | \n",
